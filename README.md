## Simple blackjack terminal game made in Python
# Not well-coded nor optimized, made fast and out of boredom

In blackjack, your goal is to try to reach 21 points by drawing cards from a deck, or trying to outscore the dealer without passing 21. The rules in this version differ from the actual game, where only one deck is used and there are no aces for simplicity purpouses.
